There is an app I have seen on YTB: https://magnetic-field-counter.en.softonic.com/android But BEWARE. It collects your data and is basicaly adware/malware gateway.
This code is just for the very purpose of winding coils. Its pain in the a$$ to count turns, so just attach magnet to the drill and place phone close by...it will count revolutions and hence number of turns on the coil!
